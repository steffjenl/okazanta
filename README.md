# Okazanta

Okazanta is modern open source status page software that anyone can use to create a clean and accessible status page for any kind of services.

This project is a fork of the currently unmaintained [Cachet](https://github.com/CachetHQ/Cachet) project.

Okazanta was created with two purposes.

1. To maintain, update, and modernise Cachet, squashing bugs, and updating security.

2. To add realtime server and site status monitoring with automatic alerts and status page updates.

Okazanta is released under the BSD-3 license [![Software License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-BSD3-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](LICENSE)

## Okawhat?

The name (loosely) comes from the Esperanto word for occurrence or incident. Both of those words seem a good fit for an app that reports what is happening, the OK at the sart of the word implies a 'positive status check', and since the project is universal and open to all, why not a little bit of Esperanto :)
